# python_science_work
Codes, required for realizations of different science works, in specific:
1) x_ray_analysis.py - creating multiple color maps of distributions to display the results of x-ray quality control of new detectors
2) hysto.py - creation of an energy spectrum of 137Ce during the "Test-Beam-like" test of SiPM SensL FC-30035
3) coords.py - visualisation of a position of a beam during the Test-Beam-like" test of SiPM SensL FC-30035  
A lot of codes written in C++ for ROOT can't be displayed here due to some private restrictions - these codes were done not only by Me, but also by other members of our scientific group
